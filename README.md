# ghosted
Ghosted is a lightweight Chrome extension that hides annoying people on Facebook (without blocking them).

Why use ghosted? You could unfollow someone, but that doesn't prevent you from seeing their comments.

Or you could block someone, but that's a rather heavy-handed solution. The blocked person might figure out that they've been blocked, which is not always what you want.

Ghosted makes the offending party's comments and posts fade or vanish. If you REALLY need to see a post, it takes just 3 clicks to reduce the transparency filter.

Useful for trolls, embarrassing relatives, frenemies, and jilted lovers.

Ghosted is completely unoffocial and not affiliated with Facebook, Inc. in any way.

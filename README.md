# ghosted
Ghosted is a Chrome extension that hides annoying people on Facebook (without blocking them).

You can unfollow someone, but that doesn't prevent you from seeing their comments. 

Or you could block someone, but that's a rather heavy-handed solution. The blocked person might figure out that they've been blocked, which is not always what you want.

Ghosted makes the offending party's comments and posts fade or vanish. If you REALLY need to see a post, it takes just 3 clicks to reduce the transparency filter.

Useful for trolls, embarrassing relatives, frenemies, and jilted lovers.
